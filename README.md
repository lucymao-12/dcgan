#[Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)

This was the final project for McGill's COMP551: Applied Machine Learning.

My group and I recreated the paper in the title.

The model this paper uses is called a deep convolutional generative adversarial network, which uses strided convolutional layers instead of pooling layers to downsample the data.

A much more in depth description of the entire project is written in the overleaf pdf provided.
